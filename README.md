## Steps Included while writing the code.
1) Checked if direction and protocol matches. If not, no point in evaluating further and return false.
2) For verification of port, if port not equal continue or if input in range convert it to a list and check.
3) Followed the same step for IP verfication and converted string to integer by replacing "." with "" and compared integers.
4) Throw an exception if input not in correct format.

## Test Cases

* ("outbound", "udp", 1000, "52.12.48.92")
* ("inbound", "udp", 53, "192.165.2.5")
* ("inbound", "udp", 53, "192.168.1.8")
* ("outbound", "udp", 1024, "52.12.48.92")
* ("outbound", "udp", 1024, "52.12.48.92")


#### I implemeted the code using python and also included a csv file used for the input.

If given an opportunity I would like to work in Platform Team and would like to learn about features such as API support, Cluster management, authentication and authorization and would like to contribute to the company in every possible way I can.
